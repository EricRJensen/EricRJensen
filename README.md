# Eric Jensen | Geospatial Data Scientist 🌍🛰️

I build cloud-native, Earth-observation decision-support tools for land and water management, with a focus on the western US but the tools are often applied more broadly. My work sits at the intersection of **remote sensing, geospatial analytics, and operational web applications**—with an emphasis on reproducible methods, interoperability, and operationalization. 🧭📈

## Primary focus: ClimateEngine.org 🌱⚙️

Climate Engine is where most of my applied work converges: translating EO datasets into **usable analytics, reporting, and APIs** for practitioners. 🧑‍💻📊

**What I work on**
- **Web application capabilities:** interactive mapping + time series analytics, custom basemaps/reference overlays, and categorical masking to focus analyses on specific land cover classes/features 🗺️⏱️
- **Reporting workflows:** automated, repeatable outputs (e.g., Climate Engine reporting) designed for applied decision-making 🧾🌾
- **Developer-facing services:** API endpoints and cloud automation that make Climate Engine’s capabilities usable beyond the UI 🔌☁️
- **Scientific communication:** ongoing writing and synthesis around Climate Engine’s applications and impact ✍️📚

## Other applied projects 🧪💧

- **Groundwater-dependent ecosystems tooling:** EO-assisted workflows for mapping, delineation, and attribution of springs, riparian/wetland features, and groundwater-dependent ecosystems 💧🌿
- **EO foundation models:** applying Google Satellite Embeddings, TimesFM and other foundation models for mapping and forecasting 🛰️🔮

## Community work (secondary) 🏞️🏘️

- **FoCo ECo:** building technical infrastructure to support local environmental work in Fort Collins, including automation and synthesis of municipal calendars/documents using Google Gemini 🗓️📝
