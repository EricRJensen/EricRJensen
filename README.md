# Eric Jensen | Geospatial Data Scientist 🌍🛰️

I build applied remote sensing and cloud-native decision-support data tools for land and water management in the Western U.S. My work focuses on applications of Earth observation datasets into operational analysis, automated reporting, and scalable data systems—with focus to reproducibility, performance, and usability. ⚙️☁️📈

## Climate Engine + open geospatial infrastructure 🌱⚡

**ClimateEngine.org** is the main focus of my applied work—translating EO and climate datasets into tools, services, and communication resources for practitioners and applied researchers.

In addition to Climate Engine, I'm involved in supporting the broader Earth Engine and applied remote sensing community:
- **Rangeland Analysis Platform (RAP) tools:** led initial development of RAP user support resources and built decision-support applications (e.g., RAP Production Explorer, Yield Gap reports, etc.).
- **Open data commons contributions:** helps move Climate Engine datasets into the Awesome GEE Community Catalog, expanding access to Earth Engine assets.
- **Google Developer Expert (GDE) for Earth Engine:** supporting the EO community through training, knowledge-sharing, and practical guidance.

## AI/ML in my workflow 🧠✨

I’m using EO foundation models and time-series forecasting—including Google Satellite Embeddings and TimesFM—alongside LLM tooling (e.g., Gemini) to accelerate synthesis, evaluation, and decision-support pipelines.
