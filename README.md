# Eric Jensen | Geospatial Data Scientist 🌍🛰️

I build applied remote sensing and cloud-native decision-support data tools for land and water management in the Western U.S. My work focuses on turning Earth observation datasets into operational analytics, automated reporting, and scalable geospatial systems—with strong attention to reproducibility, performance, and usability in real workflows. ⚙️☁️📈

Climate Engine + open geospatial infrastructure 🌱⚡

**ClimateEngine.org** is the main hub of my applied work—translating EO and climate datasets into practitioner-ready tools, services, and communication.

In addition to Climate Engine, I'm involved in supporting the broader Earth Engine and applied remote sensing community:
- **Rangeland Analysis Platform (RAP) tools + enablement:** led development of RAP user support infrastructure and building decision-support applications (e.g., RAP Production Explorer, Yield Gap reports, etc.).
- **Open data commons contributions:** helping move Climate Engine datasets into the **Awesome GEE Community Catalog**, expanding access to community-shared Earth Engine assets.
- **Google Developer Expert (GDE) for Earth Engine:** supporting the EO community through enablement, knowledge-sharing, and practical guidance.

## AI/ML in my workflow 🧠✨

I’m increasingly using EO foundation models and time-series forecasting—including Google Satellite Embeddings and TimesFM—alongside LLM tooling (e.g., Gemini) to accelerate synthesis, evaluation, and decision-support pipelines.
